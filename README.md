# ToUpper-ToLower

I recreated the two string functions toupper and tolower which you find in the standard lib ctype.h. 
toupper converts a lowercase char to a uppercase char and tolower converts a uppercase char to a lowercase char. 
I only wrote this for educational porpuses.
You can use this code snippet for your own code or for trying to understand C basics.

Have fun!
